# Changelog
## 3.2.9 (2026-10-05)
**Update**
- RD Copyright ESE updated ([per DMM post](https://www.patreon.com/debridmediamanager/posts/complete-list-of-158388927))
  - If you're using Real Debrid and your template version is older than v3.2.6, you need to run template again to get this update.
- Updated all Tamtaro formatters to include language and subtitle track details, whenever available via probed media info. Re-run the template to get these updated formatters.
  - Superscripts above your preferred language can tell whether the audio is describeb audio (ᴇɴᵈᵉˢᶜʳⁱᵇᵉᵈ) or commentary track (ᶜᵒᵐᵐ)
  - Subtitles for only foreign dialogue/on-screen signs (ᴇɴᶠᵒʳᶜᵉᵈ), subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing (ᴇɴᶜᶜ), and subtitles for English dub in anime, aka dubtitles (ᴇɴᵈᵘᵇ)   
- Enabled RemuxDB Integration inside AIOStreams -> Filters -> Miscellaneous 

## 3.2.8 (2026-09-20)
**Minor**
- Fixed some backend typo for a syncedURL inside template that doesn't affect your setup (selfhosters won't see this template error inside their AIOStreams log)
- Tweaked HTTP-Only Variant so they keep more results by default (disabled SELect Engine)
- Addon name defaults to "SELection", you can change it inside Miscellaneous Options

## 3.2.7 (2026-09-19)
**Changes**
- Added Hi10P filter to Device Specific Exclusions
  - Many devices have playback issues (black screens/stuttering) when playing 10-bit H.264 (Hi10P) videos
- Added PenguPlay to Addon Preset: you must input your personalized manifest URL, found inside Addon Preset Modifications
  - PenguPlay is an actively maintained HTTP addon with extensive coverage. Make an account over at [PenguPlay](https://pengu.uk) to obtain your manifest URL. If left blank, PenguPlay will not be included in your setup.
- Lowered default scores for Anime Sub Levels
  - L1 = 100, L2 = 200, L3 = 300
- Fixed some syncedURLs typos and re-arranged them inside template as placeholders, so AIOS instances should whitelist both short and long versions appropriately

**SyncedURLs** (auto-update)
- Tweaked "Problematic Title" ISE and ESE
  - Added some new titles (Ann Droid), and Season 17 of Bleach should work better

## 3.2.6 (2026-09-07)
**New for Nour & fellow anime enjoyers**
- Sub Levels Regex & RSE are here!
  - https://git.tamtaro.de/for-nour-Regex.json & https://git.tamtaro.de/for-nour-RSE.json
  - Sub levels are how nekoBT attempts to categorize the quality of a release's subtitles. The higher the sub level (from L0 to L4), the more extensive the work put into the subtitles. **Default** prioritizes higher sub levels, boosting their SEL scores up to 500. Disable under "Sorting Options"
  - Debrid users: Must switch on "Leave Auto Title Tags in Filename" inside your nekoBT addon 
    - this is enabled now by default if you import my Addon Preset again (just make the edit yourself; doing this will erase any other addons you personally added)
  - Usenet users: ameNZB.moe, a free indexer with generous daily limits, has some releases with sub level tags

**Update**
- Health Checks variants now include P2P as backup when your Debrid service is down, *only if* you specifically enabled "Includes P2P Addons" inside "Addon Preset Modifications" menu of template

## 3.2.5 (2026-09-06)
**New**
- Auto-activation for Health Checks services using variants (ignore if you chose to keep your existing Variants during template import)
  - If you're using `base config` installation: whenever torbox, premiumize, real-debrid, or torrin is down (I had to pick 4, there is a limit), that service will auto-disable itself so addons will not return any results from that down service.
  - If you're not using `base config` or if you're not importing my variants at all: the fallback streams removal via SEL from v3.2.4 will still work as usual
- Some minor edits to Health Checks ID naming so both the syncedESE and Health Checks page match and should work

## 3.2.4 (2026-09-05)
**New**
- Health Checks & synced ESE v2.1.7 incorporating these Health Checks
  - Torbox, Premiumize, Real Debrid, and Torrentio now have Health Checks added, when you next run this template update
  - New synced ESE v2.1.7 will remove results from any of the above mentioned services/addon when Health Checks deem them `down`
- Added 'No HLG' into Device Specific Exclusionis (for those using NVidia Shield Pro)

## 3.2.3 (2026-09-04)
**Change**
- Minor edits to Variants
- ISE v2.2.1 (auto-updated)
  - Added more titles to "Problematic Title Bypass"
  - Removed 0Cached
  - Revised Library (using count == 1 so that it doesn't trigger for library passthrough as often)

**New**
- New ESE, "Problematic Title Discard" added to synced ESE v2.1.6 (auto-updated)
  - Example: discarding Bleach TYBW (Season 17) streams from pre-TYBW seasons' result
- New option for Mobile Backup (bottom pins), you can now prioritize "Mobile Backup Language"
  - Requires a language to be selected inside "Language Passthrough Options"

## 3.2.2 (2026-08-31)
**Fix**
- SELect Refinement window no longer appears blank
- Tamtaro (Default) formatter selection now works as intended
 
## 3.2.1 (2026-08-31)
**Change**
- New "Setup Variants" toggle allows you to include template's variants or keep your existing
- New "HTTP Only" Variant added
- Fixed some CEL for variants, now HTTP is excluded from all variants except HTTP Only
- Importing this template will now erase your template import history
  - You won't get notification to update my now dead Partial Template anymore
- Fixed some errors in various Formatters
- Re-arranged various template options around

## 3.2.0 (2026-08-30)
**New**
- Added three Variants to go along with your Base Config once you complete my setup template.
  - `Debrid Only Variant`. Disables all usenet related services and addons from your base config. If your base config contains Http & P2P streams, then they are retained.
  - `Usenet Only Variant`. Disables all debrid/p2p related services and addons from your base config. If your base config contains Http streams, then they are retained.
  - `Nuvio P2P Instant Variant`. Inserts p2p-only scrapers, switches to Tamtaro "(Nuvio P2P Instant)" formatter, strips debrid/usenet/http services and addons, and disables seeder-specific filter & sorting.
  - To use these variants, go to Save & Install page, select one of the Variants to get a new manifest URL for your installation.
  ![alt text](images/screenshots/aios-variants.png)
- New submenu "Backup Options", found under Advanced Options
  - Configure backup streams (pinned to the bottom) for when your debrid services are unavailable or when you're on mobile data. These streams are exempt from all subsequent filtering.
  - Previous Mobile Backup options are found here, along with two new Backup options, Http & P2P
  - Each Backup Option has two number fields, you need to input something in both to enable said Backup Option.
    - Example: Pin to the bottom 2 HTTP streams per Resolution, total 5 HTTP streams. 
- New Formatter Variant: Tamtaro (Nuvio P2P Instant) as requested. 
  - This is same as Tamtaro (Default) with a few changes: removed p2p marker on p2p results, flattened the Name Template so they appear in one horizontal line, and inserted the full filename at the bottom.
  - These changese (& any Tamtaro variants) are prone to change, per popular request or my fancy.
- New SEL for ESE v2.1.3: "Multi-Ep Anime"
  - This removes some falsely labeled anime files where AIOS thinks are multi-episode packs
  - Example: `Dr..STONE.(2019)-S04E16-074-` is currently parsed as Season 4 Episode 16 to 74, resulting in false episode matching
  - This SEL may remove genuine multi-episode packs too, so let me know if that happens

**Changes**
- Final Filters got updated. 
  - Fixed issue with "Top N per Resolution Only" returning all streams
  - "Top N per Resolution Only" and "Top N per Quality/Resolution Only" are now aware of each other. When selecting something in both, a new SEL is created combining both logic
    - Example: Selecting "Top 3 Per Quality/Resolution Only" and "Top 6 per Resolution Only" will combine into "Top 3 Per Quality/Resolution Only (Max 6 Per Resolution)"
    - As before, Backup streams, library, and SeaDex streams are exempt.
- titleMatching.ambiguousResults now sets to "discard"
  - This solves various instances where ambiguous (and wrong) results are kept such as when searching for Dark Matter (2024), you will no longer see false results from Dark Matter (2015) series
- Small tweaks and fixes (but took me a long time ._,) to all included formatter variants
- TVDB API is now optional, temporarily, since new users are having issues with obtaining new API. If you have TVDB API, I strongly recommend entering it still, as it improves reliability for various metadata-reliant features.
- Permanently retiring Partial Setup Template, RIP.
- Fixed bug to Final Q/R SELection where it didn't use your SELect Usenet number in its threshold calculation

## 3.1.3 (2026-08-23)
**Some changes:**
- Tightened "Final Q SELection" thresholds with a defined maximum, so you're less likely to see lower Quality streams; re-apply template to see the newer limit
-  Fixed Portuguese (Brazil) RSE score boost not being applied. If you're using PT-BR profile & recently used v3.1.x version, please run the template again
- "Global Result Limit" now adjusts the basic filter Result Limits instead of inserting a Required SEL
- Introduced a new ISE entry "Problematic Title Bypass" to help bypass title matching known problematic titles such as WWE SummerSlam, Love is Blind: UK, and Love Island USA. I will update this list on my end without you having to do anything.
- If you select both "Keep Unknown Resolution" and "Keep Unknown Quality" inside "SELect Refinement" section, a third SEL will appear to specifically "Keep Unknown Quality & Resolution".
  - Individually, "Keep Unknown Resolution" only keeps high quality Unkonwn Resolution & "Keep Unkown Quality" only keeps high resolution Unknown Quality
- If you select "Keep 720P Resolution" inside "SELect Refinement" then "Top N Per Resolution" or "Top N Per Quality/Resolution" inside Final Filters will also keep 720P Resolution
- No more two of same language appearing inside Preferred Languages/Subtitles when using Language Passthrough Options
- Removed "LQ w/o Proper Tags" from ESE

## 3.1.2 (2026-08-17)
- "Formatter Style" is now a mandatory field so it's not accidentally left blank, causing undefined error upon saving
- Reverted name change back to "Final R SELection" & "Final Q SELection" (ESE v2.1.1)

## 3.1.1 (2026-08-17)
- Added back selOverrides to disable cached SELs in synced ESE (old names: Final R SELection and Final Q SELection are lingering in AIOStreams due to cache) 

## 3.1.0 (2026-08-17)
**New**
- Added "1080P Remux Boost" inside Sort Options. Choose whether 1080P Remux ranks above 4K WEB-DL (default), or whether all 4K streams win regardless of quality (similar to v2.6.1).
- New "SELect Refinement" section underneath SELect Engine, now provides finer control over the Final SELect results 
  - 720p Resolution — Default / Remove / Keep
  - Unknown Resolution — Default / Remove / Keep
  - Unknown Quality — Default / Remove / Keep
  - Uncached Debrid — Default / Remove / Keep
- New "Top N Per Resolution Only" added to Final Filters
- Formatter: Added all Tamtaro variants under "💾 Saved formatters" regardless of which version you picked
  - You can quickly switch between `tamtaro.default, tamtaro.fullRSE, tamtaro.appleTV, tamtaro.min & tamtaro.chillio` while inside Formatter page
  - tamtaro.default
    - ![tamtaro.default](images/screenshots/tamtaro.default.png)
  - tamtaro.fullRSE
    - ![tamtaro.fullRSE](images/screenshots/tamtaro.fullRse.png)
  - tamtaro.appleTV (4 lines)
    - ![tamtaro.appleTV](images/screenshots/tamtaro.appleTV.jpg)
  - tamtaro.min
    - ![tamtaro.min](images/screenshots/tamtaro.min.png)
  - tamtaro.chillio (3 lines)
    - ![tamtaro.chillio](images/screenshots/tamtaro.chillio.jpg)
  - Also allows you to call those formatter ids inside Miscellaneous -> Variant profiles
    - ![formatter variants](<images/screenshots/aios tamtaro variant.png>)
- Full French language support: thanks @yoyovero for sharing with us the French-specific release groups!
  - New auto-synced `git.tamtaro.de/French-Regex.json` and `git.tamtaro.de/French-RSE.json`, heavily reliant on TRaSH guide for French Profiles & Vidhin's base regexes/expressions.
  - To get started, just select French in "Required Languages" & "Preferred Subtitle" fields of template to auto-import the French profile jsons.
    - "Strict Language" toggle is not recommended. There are French streams identified by our French profile (via regexes) that wouldn't appear with strict language filter.
    - Plenty of changes to your setup behind the scene:
      - Disabled Vidhin's default -10000 score to VOSTFR & "Bad Dual".
      - SeaDex removed from sort order if English isn't one of your selected languages
      - New "Non-French" rule gives -10000 score to non-French releases (as determined by our regexes), when French is your only selected language. This is the smarter method compared to strict language filter.
      - New "FR Language Passthrough" rule ensuring MULTi/VOF/VFB/VOQ/VQ-tagged releases are not removed by strict language filter.
  - For French-only setup, I was testing "SELect 5" and that worked well.
    - Optionally inside "SELect Refinement": "Keep 720p", "Keep Unknown Resolution", & "Keep Unknown Quality". 
    - For anime, you can try pinning N number of French results to the top, via "Language Passthrough Options".
    - For Dual Language setup, you can pick the language you want on top by pinning it inside Language Passthrough Options

**Update**
- Final Filters section is now simplified around
  - Top Resolution Only
  - Top N per Resolution Only
  - Top M per Quality/Resolution Only
  - Global Result Limit
  - The old Unknown Resolution / Unknown Quality controls have moved into the new SELect Refinement section instead
- Removed Debridio Watchtower from Add-on Preset since it's been deprecated

**Synced URLs**
- French-RSE.json (new)
- French-Regex.json (new)
- ESE.json
  - SeaDex Duplicates: Now checks addon(cached(streams),'SeaDex') first and prefers cached SeaDex addon results over the hash/group fallback
  - Protect Library & Others: Only strips CAM/TS/TC/SCR protection when daysSinceRelease > 180 so new theatrical cams (that you added to library) now stay protected for 6 months.
  - Low SEL Score: Threshold raised to 10 so this filter now needs a bigger pool of higher SEL score before it kicks in to remove negative SEL scores
  - Ongoing Season-Pack: library and SeaDex streams are now exempt from season-pack-only filtering
  - Info & Other Unwanted: external stream types are now removed too
  - LQ w/o Proper Tags: English-original content is now exempt from this low-quality-without-tags check, adds library/seadex protection
  - Final Q SELection renamed "Final SELect: Quality": Rewritten to scale thresholds with your SELect number ((2*3), (1*3)) instead of being hardcoded
  - Final R SELection renamed "Final SELect: Resolution"
- ISE.json
  - Added result passthrough when library is the only addon (such as when you're browsing library catalog)
- Excluded-Regex.json
  - removed `com` due to false triggering on  filenames/release groups containing domain strings such as for miatrix.com results
  - added a few new extensions (archive, mobile/package & ebook/comic formats)

## 3.0.4 (2026-07-30)
- Fixed "Top Overall Per Quality/Resolution Only" bug when 0

## 3.0.3 (2026-07-30)
- **Bug Fix**
  - "Debrid First" priority now works when "Boost Uncached Usenet" is selected
  - "Pin Top Score Per Resolution" now correctly handles scenario where multiple streams have same max SEL score

- **Update**
  - episodeTitleMatching now defaults to false
    - Unreliable at the moment as multiple people have reported seeing less results
  - "Protect Library & Others" from synced ESE is now moved in-line, placed right after Device Specific Exclusions & Low Bitrate ESEs
    - This allows your library & seadex to respect those Device Specific Exclusion and Low Bitrate filters
  - Cleaned up Usenet Options, removing "☑ NZB-Only Pin/Passthrough" options
  - Soft Low Bitrate option now boosts SEL score instead of an entry in PSE
    - `Prioritize streams within the bitrate cap (via boosting SEL Score) instead of removing higher-bitrate streams. Within each Quality/Resolution group, larger files move lower in the list and are retained mainly as backups when fewer lower-bitrate choices exist.`
  - "Pin Top Overall" SEL series now rewritten with improved logic. SeaDex results are included in the pin. 
  - SELect 0 now also disables "Final R SELection"
    - If you choose SELect 0, best to use it with "Final Filter Options" such as "Top Overall Per Quality/Resolution Only" to clean up the massive list as a result
  - AppleTV (4-Line formatter) now has bitrate added back and loosened title truncation
  - Removed Usenet toggle from Meteor for Torbox Pro tier
    - "Usenet removed from Meteor as the search api is being discontinued" per Midnight
  - Renamed various headers/descriptions

## 3.0.2 (2026-07-27)
- Fixed bug with Pin Top Overall Per Q/R
- Fixed torznab url bug on stable AIOStreams
- Reworded some template descriptions
  - SELect Engine for clarity: `Sets a range of streams kept per Quality/Resolution: your number is the minimum, and up to 1.5× that number may be kept when needed. Default is 3 (usually 3-5 per group, ~15-20 total). Applies to Cached Debrid, HTTP, and P2P streams only. Enter 0 to disable.`
- Fixed missing audiotags in Formatter. 
  - Note: these formatters are for nightly only. If you're on stable, use the built-in Tamtaro inside Formatter page

## 3.0.1 (2026-07-27)
- Removed idMatched from Merge Duplicates to fix incompatibility issue in stable AIOStreams

## 3.0.0 (2026-07-27)

- Largest revamp since v2.0.0, new ESE logic & many template options got reconsolidated
- **Core Filtering Engine Overhaul**
  - The old "Core Filtering Engine" (Standard/Extended SEL) has been replaced with a new "QR SELect Engine," which now separates Debrid/HTTP/P2P filtering from Usenet filtering entirely. 
  - `coreFilter` switched from a dropdown (standard/extended) to a numeric "SELect" value defaulting to 2, and a brand-new `coreFilterUsenet` field lets you set the SELect threshold for Usenet independently, with 0 to disable it.
- **New Debrid/Usenet Sort Preference**
  - A new `coreFilterPriority` option lets you choose how Usenet and Debrid streams are prioritized against each other: Merged (default, equal priority), Usenet First, or Debrid First
  - Each selection changes the Stream Type sort direction inside Sort Order and the content inside Preferred Stream Types Filter page may appear weird. This is intentional to achieve merging behaviour of unlisted Stream Types.
- **Strict Language Filtering Added**
  - A new `strictLanguage` toggle removes the automatic appendment of *Original, Dual Audio, Multi, Dubbed, and Unknown* language tags, so only your explicitly selected languages get added to the Required Languages filter.
- **Bitrate Cap Changes**
  - Default bitrate cap lowered from 150 Mbps to 100 Mbps, with option tiers changed (75 added, 150 removed, top option now labeled ">100 Uncapped" instead of ">150 Uncapped")
- **Final Filter / Passthrough Restructuring**
  - "Limit Options" renamed to "Final Filter Options" and simplified
    - `top1QualRes`, `top1Res`, and the visual tag limit (visualTag) removed
    - `removeUnknownRes`, `removeUnknownQuality`, and a new `topResOnly` moved in from the old "Core Filter Modifications" section
  - "Passthrough Options" renamed to "Pin Options" and reworked
    - All the previous passthrough & pin top 1 SELs (such as `overallTopQualRes`, `top1QualResPin`, and `top1ResPin`) were removed 
    - Added three new numerically adjustable pin controls: `topQualResPin` (Pin Top Overall Per Q/R, max 4 pairs), `topResPin` (Pin Top Overall Per Resolution, max 2 res), and `topResPinScore` (Pin Top Score Per Resolution, max 2 res).
- **Usenet Options**
  - Boost Cached Usenet removed; "Boost All Usenet" renamed to "Boost Uncached Usenet"
  - "Overall Passthrough per Q/R" option renamed to "Pin Top Usenet Per Q/R" with its constraints simplified (dropped the min/max/forceInUi limits).
    - Fixed a bug where it would default to 1 when clicking on it
- **Sorting Order**
  - Stream Expression now sorts before Resolution/Quality (previously after), and P2P sorting now also includes Stream Type in the order.
  - Language is slightly higher (above SEL Score) when English is not one of the selected languages.
- **Minor Updates**
  - Added new "VC-1 Encode" exclusion option
  - MediaFusion now enabled by default
  - ComeTorz (`https://comet.feels.legal/torznab/api`) now replaces marketplace Comet
    - ComeTorz provides accurate media-info when available (aka accurate languages), and failover works to trigger. 
  - STorz (torznab) now replaced by marketplace StremThru addon
    - with ComeTorz providing torznab endpoint capabilities, we can now switch back to the og ST addon, which does provide more results (private torrents) in less time. It also provides accurate media-info languages, unlike marketplace Comet. We lose out on failover, hence ComeTorz is placed higher in priority. 
  - Meteor's Usenet options is now only pre-selected for Torbox - Pro Tier
  - ENS (Easynews Search) addon is auto-included if Easynews service is detected
  - Sootio is now included only if "Includes HTTP" is toggled
- **Formatter Updates**
  - Rewrote all formatters to make use of the recent formatter changes from Viren
  - Added new "Chillio" formatter style option (thanks @curiousnomadx)
  - Some neat updates:
    - All formatters now has fallbacks to show stream.network and stream.editions if you're not using ranked stream expressions from this template
    - If accurate language (media-info) is found, ✓ will replace the usual ⛿
    - stream.date (▦) will be shown when available, on series such as the Daily Show
    - preloading icon (➤) will appear on non-library preload, instead of the usual ✎ for those that want to turn this feature on
    - Cleaned up a lot of visual imperfections, not possible before
    - Last but not least, I really love the new Minimalist version, I think you will like it too!
- **Synced URL v2.0.0 Update**
  - On your next template update, it will import these shorter synced urls into your AIOStreams (template will support both the new & the previously longer GitHub urls)
    - `https://git.tamtaro.de/ESE.json`
    - `https://git.tamtaro.de/ISE.json`
    - `https://git.tamtaro.de/PSE.json`
    - `https://git.tamtaro.de/Excluded-Regex.json`
  - New import of the template will use the ESE.json (v2.0) going forward, while the ESEs-standard and ESEs-extended.json (v1.3.0) are phasing out. **The old ESE jsons are not updated to v2.0.0**, but still there so existing SEL setups continue to work as before. The other jsons (ISE, PSE, Excluded-Regex jsons) are updated, as they should not break existing setup.
- **Changes in ESE v2.0.0**
  - SeaDex Duplicates (was Extra SeaDex)
    - added per-release-group hash/group dedupe for both "best" and "alt" tiers
  - Protect Library & Others (was No Sootio Library)
    - now protects library (except uncached debrid & CAM/TS/TC/SCR quality), SeaDex, and pin "🎯 Smart Play" streams
  - Info & Other Unwanted (was Bad NZBs)
    - now also removes info-type streams, zero-size streams, uncached library, and trailer/teaser keywords
  - Bad 4k Anime 
    - rseMatched now checks cached streams only, tightening the match
  - Upscaled 4k
    - added Asian T1/T2/T3 tier tags to the allow-list logic
  - LQ w/o Proper Tags
    -  new rule to filter low-quality streams missing a proper release-group tag or known language
  - Low Seeders
    - removed the adaptive quartile/percentile thresholds, now simply a flat 1-seeder cutoff
  - Low SEL Score
    - trigger threshold loosened from "<10" to "<5" remaining streams
  - SELect Q/R ESEs
    - now use perGroup() filtering instead of slice(), reducing massive amount of code
    - now splits QR filtering to Cached Non-Usenet, Cached Usenet, Uncached, which allows for better independent debrid/usenet control via template options
    - Previous Final Limit (All) now splits into two separate ESEs: Final Q SELection & Final R SELection, both with new and improved logic
  - Unknown Resolution/Quality Filters now removed from ESE, same options now inside template's Final Filter Options
- **Changes in PSE v2.0.0**
  - Complete revamp, introducing an alternate sort order based on Quality/Resolution, for use with "Stream Expressions" inside Sort Order
- **Changes in ISE v2.0.0**
  - Removed digitalRelease Bypass
- **Partial SEL Setup**
  - Now erases existing inline excludedRegex, unless 'Synced URL Only' is toggled
  - No further update to Partial Template, it will continues to add the old version of ESEs (extended/standard), until I phase this template out completely. To get the latest v2.0 ESE, please use the Complete SEL Setup Template

- **Changes to AIOStreams Configuration**
  - Title Episode Matching
  - Merge Duplicates
  - HTTP Dedupe set to per_addon (hidden option)
  - Failover cross-over enabled for both Debrid & Usenet

## 2.6.1 (2026-05-16)
- **Update:**
  - Previously mentioned excludedRegexPatterns now moved into a syncedURL for excludedRegex
    - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tam-Taro/SEL-Filtering-and-Sorting/refs/heads/main/AIOStreams-SyncedURLs/Tamtaro-synced-excluded-regex.json`
    - This allows me to easily update regex without having to re-update your excluded regex manually
    - Partial & Complete now has this new syncedUrl included

## 2.6.0 (2026-05-16)
- **Update**
  - Expanded the `excludedRegexPatterns` to support case insensitivity & include some more file extensions (thanks Tick & iMakeSoftware)
      - Selfhosters, please add `REGEX_FILTER_ACCESS=all` if you haven't already so this custom regex works (see [FAQ entry](https://discord.com/channels/1225024298490662974/1485057373453156666/1505253232031830058))
      - Public AIOStreams users, **disable this Regex until it's allowed in ~24h by your hoster** (to avoid the not allowed regex error when trying to save).
  - Default OpenSubtitles addon now has `movieHashPlusAutoAdjustment` setting set to `false` (thanks Arcitec)
  - `showFilterStatsOnNoStreams` now disabled
    - To prevent regular users from accidentally clicking on a Stat stream and get stuck on Viren's repo for eternity
  - `Mobile Backup` under `Bitrate Options` now excludes `'CAM','TS','TC','SCR' when picking low bitrate options to pin to the bottom (thanks umbliger for the suggestion)
- **New**
  - If RD service is selected during onboarding of template:
    - `RD Copyright (per DMM)` SEL will appear in your list of ESE
      - See DMM's post for more information: https://www.patreon.com/posts/complete-list-of-158388927
    - Vidhin's RSE `x265` (which penalizes certain x265 streams) will be disabled by selOverride
      - Since RD filters most of x264 streams, disabling this RSE ensures remaining streams, although not the best quality, are not negatively scored and thus further removed by Low SEL Score. 
  - If `German` is selected as one of your `Preferred Languages`
    - Vidhin's German regexes and ranked stream expressions synced urls will be used instead of the default English preset
  - If `Portuguese (Brazil)` is selected as one of your `Preferred Languages`
    - A custom ranked stream expression `PT-BR Group` courtesy of Sterzeck, will be added to RSE field, scoring 10000 for streams matching any of these Brazillian release groups
  - If `Portuguese (Brazil)` is selected for `Language Passthrough` under `Language Passthrough Options`
    - An additional passthrough SEL will be added to passthrough the `PT-BR Group` ranked stream expression provided by Sterzeck, ensuring they don't get filtered out by subsequent filters.
- **New to syncedURLs**
  - `RD Copyright (per DMM)` now added to synced ESE (v1.2.8)
    - It becomes disabled in synced ESE and moves up the front of inline ESE list when importing Complete SEL Setup template.

If you want deeper integration for your particular language, feel free to reach out over Discord (like Sterzeck did with PT-BR), we can figure something out together. At minimum, we need a list of release groups specific for your language.

## 2.5.2 (2026-05-11)
- Bug fixes:
  - MediaFusion add-on now actually defaults to disabled - enable whenever server is online.
  - Catalogs from un-selected services or add-on options (such as yastream) will not show inside AIOStreams config page anymore

## 2.5.1 (2026-05-10)
- Bug fix:
  - Min restraint increased from 0 to 1 for `Overall Passthrough Per Quality/Resolution` and `Usenet Passthrough Per Quality/Resolution`

## 2.5.0 (2026-05-10)
- **New:** 
  - `Mobile Backup Bitrate (Mbps)` & `Mobile Backup Amount` inside `Bitrate Options` submenu. 
    - Allows you to pin some streams in 1080p/720p to the bottom of your regular results; amount & bitrate cap are adjustable.
  - `Overall Passthrough Per Quality/Resolution` inside `Passthrough Options` submeu.
    - Allows you to bypass the default 3 or 6 Per Quality/Resolution set by Standard/Extended Core Filtering Engine
    - Set a number higher than the default (3 or 6) to see an effect. This option takes the overall top results (among all stream types except uncached debrid, from 4K to 720P) as sorted by setup. To increase only usenet results, use the same option inside 'Usenet Options'
- **Update:**
  - `Bitrate Cap` (Static or Dynamic) now placed higher up in the ESE list, so various visual tags and language passthroughs respect the bitrate cap
  - `Bad 4K Anime` ESE filter has a slight change, to check `originalLanguage == 'Japanese'` before triggering itself
    - To manually update this SEL, replace the old `originalLanguage != 'English'` with the change above
  - `Usenet Passthrough Per Quality/Resolution` was limited to 6, now extends option to 15 streams per Q/R
  - `Debridio TV` addon & catalogs removed
  - `MediaFusion` defaults to disabled. Enable this yourself whenever MediaFusion servers are back online.

## 2.4.2 (2026-05-04)
- `AV1 Encode` option is now added to `Device Specific Exclusions`
- Bug fixes
  - `Keep Existing` Logo option no longer returns 'none' URL
  - inline syncedUrl issue now fixed for Partial Template

## 2.4.1 (2026-05-03)
- Bug fixes
  - DebridioTV addon shouldn't be included anymore if you didn't select Debridio
  - logoURL now defaults to proper url for our SEL logo
  - inline syncedURL should now switch to proper standard or extended per your selection

## 2.4.0 (2026-05-03)
- **Various AIOStreams Default Settings**
  - Filters -> Deduplicator now has `Library Stream Behaviour` set to `Prefer`
  - Filters -> Miscellaneous -> Digital Release Filter now disabled, by popular vote. You can enable inside template `Miscellaneous Options`. My `digitalRelease Bypass` synced ISE will remain for those that use this filter. Instead of seeing no streams at all, my synced ISE lets through properly labeled quality leaks (`'CAM','TS','TC','SCR','WEBRip'`) reducing the chance of fake streams while allowing you keep this digital filter enabled.
  - Filters -> Regex -> Excluded Regex, now has the following regex to exclude various non-stream extensions (replacing previous Excluded Keywords): `\.(iso|r\d{2}|zip|rar|7z|tar|gz|zipx|arj|txt|nfo|jpg|png|pdf|exe|bat|cmd|scr|msi|ps1|vbs|js|jar|com|pif|reg|dll|sys|lnk|url)$`
    - Selfhosters, please add `REGEX_FILTER_ACCESS=all` if you haven't already so this custom regex works
    - Public AIOStreams users should be fine, once my template syncs up (in 24h; ***otherwise if you see error, just disable this Regex until it's allowed in 24h***).

- **Addon Settings**
  - Updated UI so now it's required to choose the addon preset, and easier for you to select "Addon Preset: None" to retain your existing addons
  - Re-arranged priority of addon preset so that those addons with pontetial for accurate languages media-info are prioritized (built-in -- SeaDex, Library, STorz, Knaben, NekoBT -- & Meteor, Torrentio)
  - Removed `Torbox Search`, in favour of Meteor's TorBox searching capabilities. The newznab addon `Searchⁿᶻᵇ` (appears if you toggle Torbox Pro) is kept for now, until Meteor usenet search capability is fleshed out.
  - `NekoBT` replaces `AnimeTosho` for anime addon
  - HTTP Update: 
    - Added yastream (korean streams + 2 kisskh catalogs), added HdHub, updated webstreamr addon url, removed Nuvio Streams
  - Debridio Update:
    - Added Debridio TV (merging all into two catalogs: `English-Speaking` and `Non-English`)
  - Enabled catalogs (Discovery only) for `Library` addon
    - Useful to directly watch stuff you personally added, when they fail to show up in the usual way due to filename issues
  - **REMEMBER TO RE-INSTALL AIOS after editing catalogs**

- **Language Settings**
  - New `Preferred Embedded Subtitle` option. You can now add priority for embedded sub languages (if available, usually from built-in addons, StremThru Torz, Meteor, or Torrentio)
  - New `Language Passthrough Options` submenu
    - All passthrough options related to Language now moved to this section
    - New `Embedded Subtitle Passthrough`: similar to `language()` passthrough, but using `subtitles()` which takes advantage of accurate media-info if available
    - For example, you can now passthrough & pin `Portugese` subtitles for Anime only, without having to also passthrough Portugese audio.

- **Formatter**
  - Added smallcap font parsing for `AvailNZB 💚` {stream.message}

- **Sorting Options**
  - New `Embedded Subtitle Boost`: Priority given to streams with embedded subtitle of your preferred subtitle languages. This will only affect streams that have accurate media info showing subtitle languages, such as some streams from built-in addons, Stremthru Storz, Meteor, or Torrentio.

- **Device Specific Exclusions**
  - Audio exclusions (DTS or TrueHD) now include "Unknown BD Audio" by default so one less selection necessary.

- **Bitrate Options**
  - Reworked this submenu for better clarity and function
    - Two ESEs: 
      - `Static Bitrate Cap` (default when selecting <150 Mbps)
      - `Dynamic Bitrate Cap` (previous SEL that further caps bitrate based on resolution for an even further bandwidth-saving setup: 80% at 4K resolution, 50% at 1080P and 30% at 720P)
    - Two PSEs: 
      - Toggle `Soft Bitrate Cap` to move either of the Static or Dynamic Bitrate Cap SEL into PSE field to rank lower bitrate streams higher (thus keeping streams outside bitrate cap instead of excluding them).

- **`Passthrough Options`**
  - This section now only has Visual Tag & Top 1 passthrough SELs (previous Language passthrough now found inside its own `Language Passthrough Options` submenu)

- **New to Usenet Options**
  - Pin options for `☑ NZB` and `☑ NZB-Only`: you can now pin health checked nzbs to the top
  - Added `AvailNZB 💚` from StreamNZB to be part of health-☑ usenet

- **New to `Miscellaneous Options`**
  - `Digital Release Filter` now a toggle, default is disabled.
  - `Show Statistics & Errors` toggle to quickly enable Statistic and Error streams at the bottom for debugging
  - `Addon Logo` is now customizable with custom URL possible. Use this and Hamtaro will miss you, so don't.

- **New to Synced URLs (auto-updates)**
  - PSE v1.2.1: Added `AvailNZB 💚` to be part of stream ranking
  - ESE v1.2.6: Removed all disabled Device Specific Exclusion SELs - please use template to add these so they can appear in appropriate order (before your various additional/passthrough SELs)
  - ISE v1.2.3: Updated digitalRelease Bypass SEL
  - `Low SEL Score` (along with `Bad 4k Anime`, `Upscaled 4k`, `Bad 4k Bluray` & `Bad 1080P Bluray`) from synced url ESE will be auto-added to inline ESE field, ensuring they run first before any other ESEs. 

- **Partial Template**
  - Copied the "Core Filter Modifications" submenu from the Complete template, you can now select `Remove Unknown Resolution` and `Remove Unknown Quality` in Partial SEL Only import

- **Credits**
  - You can quickly access GitHub and ko-fi for both myself & Vidhin at the bottom of the template
  - Also direct links to discord channel for support & Torbox for referral


## 2.3.0 (2026-04-04)
- New: Submenu buttons inside Template Wizard get a new look (no more ugly gear icons) 
- New: `Unknown Bluray Audio` in Device Specific Exclusions. 
  - If your TV can't play DTS audio for example, this prevents mislabeled Blurays from bypassing your filters.
- New: `Top Resolution Only` inside Limit Options
  - Inspired by a request from @Nomadtvx to the AIOStreams bot
  - Gives you a clean list of only the highest resolution results
- New: `Remove Unknown Resolution` and `Remove Unknown Quality` under a new "Core Filter Modifications" submenu 
  - Inspired by a request from @barabaz for cleaner results list
  - After the core filtering SEL finishes, you can now further remove any results with unknown resolutions or qualities (passthrough, SeaDex, library exempted).
- Update: Addons priority re-ordered & category labels added 
  - For Debrid, built-in addons (SeaDex, Library, Storz, Knaben, AnimeTosho) are prioritized over rest of addons due to metadata enhancement via media info from stremthru (resulting in more accurate metadata such as embedded subtitles).
- Fix: Bug reported by @prosperity., the ordering of any additional SELs & fake filters (such as 4k upscaled) are now applied during every template import, so the fake filters work properly (flow logic first introduced in v2.1.7)
- **Formatter**: 
  - `stream.subtitles` now incorporated into languages field, displaying only your preferred languages
    - If subbed languages are found (from built in addons, newznabs, Meteor or Torrentio), the subbed languages will be listed inside () as so: `⛿ sᴜʙ (ᴇɴ)`. If subbed languages is not specified then you'll see the usual `sᴜʙ`. 
 - Green, more visible `✅ ɴᴢʙ` added for healthy usenet, @fourpoint8 can be happy now. 
- **Synced URLs update**: *(auto-updates)*
  - Update to ESE v1.2.5: 
    - `Remove Unknown Resolution` and `Remove Unknown Quality` added to the very end, as disabled. As mentioned above, these can be toggled on inside Template Wizard's "Core Filter Modifications" submenu 
    - `Final Limit (All)` now factors in stremio-usenet results in making final decision on what is kept
  - Update to ISE (v1.2.2):
    - `0Cached` now also bypasses title matching for usenet results, when triggered on no cached results found
- *To be added*: pin/passthrough for Usenet Streamer's Smart Play

## 2.2.0 (2026-03-21)

- New: DV Bluray (P7) as an option for "Device Specific Exclusions" courtesy of Vidhin
  - Will need to run templatae import again to place the exclusion at appropriate spot
- Formatter: `sᴜʙ` is added onto language format, it'll display `sᴜʙ` if filename indicates subtitles (regardless of which language)
  - Useful for anime, as anything with `sᴜʙ` is a good indicator original (Japanese) audio is present
  - Note that `ᴇɴ · sᴜʙ` could either be English audio or English sub only; currently AIOS does not differentiate
- Changes to default template:
  - Service Wrap is now disabled for all addons (previously was enabled for Torrentio) due to reports of extended fetch time
  - Failover NZB is now set to `Last` (previously `Before SEL`); Make sure to set NZB passthrough if you wish to see usenet (even when there are lots of debrid results)
- Synced URLs update:
  - New: `Bad 4k Bluray` to remove only 4k Bluray (conditions loosened vs `Upscaled 4k`)
  - New: `No DV Bluray (P7)` (disabled) courtesy of Vidhin, now added onto Template's Device Specific Exclusions as selectable option
  - Update: `Upscaled 4k` now removes everything in 4K if triggered
    - Will this auto-update? If currently disabled in your synced URL (and present inside your main ESE field) then you'll need to manually reimport template. 
  - Update: `0Cached` ISE to include non-debrid sources (http, p2p & usenet) in its conditional check
    - If triggered (0 cached results found), title matching is skipped/passthrough to show potentially filtered results
    - Will this auto-update? Yes

## 2.1.9 (2026-03-13)

- Fix: fixed Usenet Cached Sorting Boost specifically

## 2.1.8 (2026-03-13)

- Fix: missing `)` in Usenet Boost SELs, causing it not to save config
- Fix: misidentified minimalist formatter, causing selection to do nothing

## 2.1.7 (2026-03-13)

- Update: Reworked filtering logic & sequencing
  - When any additional SEL is selected, 3 "fake filtering SELs" (`Bad 4k Anime`, `Upscaled 4k` and `Bad 1080P Bluray`) are disabled in synced url ESE, and get placed into top spots of regular ESE field.
  - Ensures fake filters run before any additional filtering that may affect its functionality (such as removing Remux or DV)
  - All Device Specific Exclusions will now run right after the 3 fake filters, follows by any language passthroughs, follows by any visual tags passthroughs
  - Lastly, rest of synced url ESE (minus the fake filters as are they are disabled here) will run, then follows by any Limiting SELs (which will run inside Required)
  - This order ensures your Remux/DV exclusion streams will not be included in your subsequent passthroughs.
- Update: Language Passthrough now adds an additional IncludedSE to passthrough 'language' filter in case the passthrough language is excluded in language filter
  - Also adds your passthrough language into Preferred so it would appear in Formatter.
- Update: Usenet Sorting Boost (merging cached/uncached usenet with debrid) now has an edited PSE to also merge cached library & SeaDex result
  - Solves report of SeaDex results disappearing when using optional Usenet Sorting Boost (or passthroughs)
- New: `Ignore RSE` to prevent your Ranked Stream Expression entries from being overwritten
  - All misc options now belong in its own submenu
- Formatter:
  - New `Tamtaro (Minimalist)`, further stripped down view of default. Added to both Complete/Partial template.
  - Default & AppleTV format: now hides rseMatched `UHD` and `HD` portion in eg., `UHD Remux T1`
  
## 2.1.6 (2026-03-09)
 - Update: Added *DV (ALL)* into `Device Specific Exclusions` for devices that can't use HDR fallback
 - Update: Custom option for Bitrate Limit, to enter your custom number outside the 5 options

## 2.1.5 (2026-03-09)
 - Update: Added *HDR10+ Only* into `Device Specific Exclusions` for playback issues on some older TLC TVs + Firestick

## 2.1.4 (2026-03-09)

 - New: Added new multi-select `Device Specific Exclusions` for streams your device can't handle
   - All 4k, 4k-720P Remux, DTS, TrueHD, DV-Only, HDR, DV-Only Non-Remux
     - Some LG TVs can't play any Remux, TrueHD, or DTS audio. Some Samsung TVs can't play DTS audio. Some devices can't play DV-Only Non-Remux (DV P5). Some devices can't play any 4K streams. Select appropriate exclusions right here, and not inside AIOS UI filter because these removals need to happen at specific stage in the SEL filering process to allow various fake/upscaled detection filters to work effectively.
   - Any selection will enable the corresponding synced url ESE (which also got updated to v1.2.0), to ensure they run after bad 4k/bluray SELs.
- Update: Global timeout now set to 5000 ms
   - Increase if you get too many timeouts and want to see more results
- Minor: Removed `☑ NZB-Only` optional SEL since the passthrough alternatives (`☑ NZB Passthrough` and `☑ NZB-Only Passthrough`) are better anyway

## 2.1.3 (2026-03-08)

 - New: Addon name field under Misc Options, and versioning built into addon description.
    - Defaults to AIOStreams, with select few options to choose from as suggested by #The SELebrities on discord (so you can blame them)
       - Don't like any of them? Good news! You can enter your own creativity right there in the menu
    - Choose "Keep existing name" to not replace your existing name

## 2.1.2 (2026-03-08)

 - Fixed: previously added Searchⁿᶻᵇ(Torbox) addon will now be removed in future re-importing of template when Torbox Service is not selected
 - Minor: Edited some headers and descriptions to organize template menu better

## 2.1.1 (2026-03-07)

 - Fixed: bitrate cap SEL now working
 - Fixed: Subtitle addon now adds to your setup when language is selected
 - Minor: Removed extra sootio library ESE filter

## 2.1.0 (2026-03-07)

 - New: quick links for SEL content
    - SEL Setup
       - https://git.tamtaro.de (Main GitHub)
       - https://git.tamtaro.de/complete.json

        - https://git.tamtaro.de/ESE-standard.json
 - New: Subtitle Addon option, select a language for the OpenSubtitles V3+ addon to be added
 - Update: `4K Remux` and `1080P Remux` now run *after* core SEL fake bluray filters, so having no remux shouldn't cause false positive anymore
    - Achieved by use of SEL override, enabling the corresponding remux filter inside the synced ESE list
 - Update: Reworked sort order, clearer distinctions.
    - P2P and Boost Uncached Usenet Sort Order will be Global Only
    - Debrid/Usenet will remain Cached + Uncached

## 2.0.10 (2026-03-07)

 - New/Update: Bitrate Options Submenu: Bitrate Limit
    - Check out [Avangelista's PR](https://github.com/Tam-Taro/SEL-Filtering-and-Sorting/pull/12) for more details
    - `Low Bitrate Ranking Boost` deprioritizes streams outside bitrate limit via PSE
    - `Low Bitrate Sorting Boost` sorts bitrate within same resolution/quality category from lowest to highest

## 2.0.9 (2026-03-05)

- Update: Service wrap is now enabled only for Torrentio. This prevents Torrentio from returning results when the Torrentio service is down.
- Fix: `Pin Top 1 Resolution` & `Pin Top 1 Resolution/Quality` now properly returns Library stream if library stream happens to be sorted on top.
    - If you don't want Top 1 to always pick your library stream (as that defaults to top sort), then you may need to choose No Library Boost under Sort Option
- Partial Template Update: New option to "Import Only Synced URLs".
    - If selected, this will import only the synced URLs for your core filter selection, keeping your existing regular SEL fields intact (such as optional SELs from the Complete Setup or manual additions).

## 2.0.8 (2026-03-04)

- Update: Integrated changelog directly into templates.
- Update: Usenet overhaul; all Usenet options are now under their own main header.
    - New Boost Uncached Usenet to alter how uncached Usenet vs. Debrid content sorting is handled.
    - Selecting "Boost Uncached Usenet" will move all sorting to 'Global' only.
    - Selecting either Usenet sort option adds an extra SEL in preferred stream expressions to merge Usenet/Debrid results.
- Formatter: Added a modified version for Stremio on Apple TV (thanks to @dividedby & @stepthomas) in the formatter choice selection.
- Fixed: Bug with Usenet passthrough always adding SEL when nothing is selected.

## 2.0.7 (2026-03-04)

- Change: Service wrap turned off due to issues in some AIOStreams instances.


## 2.0.6 (2026-03-03)

- Update: All passthrough streams under Passthrough Options now bypass all SEL filtering limits (e.g., those set under Additional Limit Options).
- Fixed: Language & SEL score now removed from Cached Sort when set to "No Boost."
- New: 1080p Remux filter (@thoaster).
- New: "Keep Custom SEL Scores" (@deluxas) under Misc Options; allows keeping custom edits of RSEs.
- Minor: Updated various menu descriptions for clarity.
- Minor: Cleaned up formatter for 'External Downloader' view.

## 2.0.5 (2026-03-03)

- Fixed: Anime-only language pin syntax error on saving (@blarns).
- Fixed: SEL URLs being overridden in partial template when no SEL selected (@heinzgruber).
- New: Added ☑ ɴᴢʙ Passthrough and ☑ ɴᴢʙ-Only Passthrough.
- Minor: Edited "Boost Cached Usenet" description.
- Minor: Fixed missing space after ᴀʟᴛ ʙᴇsᴛ ʀᴇʟᴇᴀsᴇ in formatter (@archdukeofsalt).

## 2.0.4 (2026-03-03)

- Fixed: Pin/passthrough selection detection. Switched to direct variable usage instead of `inputs.something == true` (@shmoush).

## 2.0.3 (2026-03-03)

- Fixed: 4K Remux not working (moved from ReSE to ESE field) (@pedronolix64gomes).

## 2.0.2 (2026-03-03)

- Update: Default language passthrough amount set to 5 (adjustable).

## 2.0.0 (2026-03-02)

**Cross-posts with my Discord Post. Release Notes for v2.0.0.**

Yoooo @The SELebrities ! I got a big template update for y'all. With the help of our lord and saviour Viren the Third (don't ask what happened to the first and second...), I’ve completely overhauled our AIOStreams SEL Templates! You no longer need to hunt through dozens of different versions of the same thing. It makes your life easy, it makes my life even easier. Took a long time but I've finished integrating most parts of my complicated setup into the new Template Wizard. It's gonna guide you through a custom setup during import process. Options galore! As always, you know what to do. Try the updated template, leave your feedback and requests over at [Discussion](https://discord.com/channels/1225024298490662974/1391478569607368924) thread. Drop a [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/tamtaro) on your way out if you appreciate the work.

To get the technical stuff out of the way, if you're an instance hosters or selfhosters, @nhyyeb @midnightignite @kuukuuma @viren_7 @funkypenguin.co.nz @srvl @a.ves, ensure these are already in your ENV:
TEMPLATE_URLS=["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tam-Taro/SEL-Filtering-and-Sorting/refs/heads/main/Tamtaro-All-Templates-for-AIOStreams.json", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vidhin05/Releases-Regex/refs/heads/main/all-templates.json"]
TEMPLATE_REFRESH_INTERVAL=3600 #1 hour. Default: 86400 (1 day)
WHITELISTED_SYNC_REFRESH_INTERVAL=3600 #1 hour. Default: 86400 (1 day)

- If you like my template (I know you will), then you can pin/feature it along with Vidhin template in AIOStreams landing page with:
  FEATURED_TEMPLATE_IDS=tamtaro.complete,Vidhin05.english-template
- If you're a selfhoster you can additionally add `SEL_SYNC_ACCESS=all` to allow all synced URLs to work (beyond the ones in my templates)

┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈․° ☣ °․┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈

# Quick Setup Overview

1. **Choose an AIOStreams instance**: Nightly is recommended but not required. #links for options.
   - **Selfhosters**: Ensure `SEL_SYNC_ACCESS=all` is set in your environment variables to receive latest SEL-related hotfixes automatically.
2. **Import Template**: Paste this URL into _AIOStreams → Save & Install :floppy_disk: → Import Template_:
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tam-Taro/SEL-Filtering-and-Sorting/main/Tamtaro-All-Templates-for-AIOStreams.json`
   - **Confirm Import** to save the templates. Most public instances should already have template.
   - Start with **"Tamtaro Complete SEL Setup"** (works for both Debrid/Usenet or P2P).
   - Follow the prompts to personalize your filtering, services, and credentials. Leave all options default to get my recommended setup.
3. **Advanced Customization**:

- Add Usenet addons if you use them.
- Browse complete list of [Optional SELs](https://github.com/Tam-Taro/SEL-Filtering-and-Sorting/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#-optional-sels), most of which are already incorporated inside template.
- Adjust **Ranked Stream Expression** scores via [Vidhin's GitHub](https://github.com/Vidhin05/Releases-Regex) for more nuanced sorting.

4. **Catalogs**: Import my JSONs (with/without anime) via trusted instance of AIOMetadata (#links). This is a separate addon from AIOStreams.
   - Refer to GitHub (end of page) for full set steps.

Pro Tip: If you want to keep your current list of addons but want my full sorting and filtering logic, use the Complete SEL Setup but simply check off "No Addons" in Addon Options, during the import step!
┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈․° ☣ °․┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈

##### What’s New: The Complete SEL Setup Experience

There are now only two templates: _Tamtaro Complete SEL Setup_ and _Tamtaro Partial SEL Setup_. See [here](https://discord.com/channels/1225024298490662974/1410118448306192425/1410123621900484678) for full description of each. When you import these templates now, AIOStreams will present you with an onboarding menu. You can toggle features on or off based on your specific needs:

- Addons Options
  - Each mode comes with a preset of recommended addons:
  - P2P Setup (No services selected): _Meteor, Comet, StremThru, TorzS, MediaFusion, Torrentio, TorrentsDB, Peerflix, Sootio, Nuvio Streams, Nuvio Anime, WebStreamr_
  - Debrid Mode (Services Selected): _SeaDex, Library, Meteor, Comet, STorz, Torrentio, MediaFusion, Knaben, AnimeTosho, Sootio_
- Dynamic Addon Options in the Wizard
  - TorBox Search is automatically added if you select Torbox service, and add the NZB version if Pro tier is selected during onboarding.
  - Selecting "No Anime" in the wizard will remove Anime Addons and related anime config from your final build.
  - HTTP Addons are automatically included in the P2P setup but remain an optional toggle for Debrid users who want backup streams for niche titles.
  - If you select "No Addons" during the import, the wizard will ignore the lists above and keep your current addon page exactly as it is, only updating your filtering and sorting.
  - You can now choose your Global Addon Timeout, which will apply across all imported addons.
    ┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈․° ☣ °․┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈

- Preferred Language option is now built into the template.
  - These are placed first in the language ranking. Original, Dual Audio, Multi, Dubbed, and Unknown are automatically appended after your selections. Fine-tune the full order in Filters → Language after import. The included formatter will display only your preferred languages.
  - Anything inside Preferred is duplicated inside Required. So streams without any of your preferred languages, beside title's Original language, will be removed.
- Excluded Visual Tags
  - By defaults, AI and 3D visual tags are excluded. If your device does not support DV, select 'DV Only' to exclude all DV streams with no HDR fallbacks. You will remove all HDR+DV streams if you simply exclude 'DV'.
  - Removing various visual tags was a popular request, so you can now decide this during Import, instead of navigating through AIOS -> Filters afterwards.
- Sorting Options
  - Streams are sorted under Global dropdown inside Cached:
    - Debrid/Usenet : _SeaDex → Resolution → Quality → Library → Stream Expression → Stream Expression Score → Language → Encode → Bitrate → Seeders_.
    - P2P Setup: _SeaDex → Resolution → Quality → Library → Stream Expression → Stream Expression Score → Seeders → Language → Encode → Bitrate_.
  - You can fine-tune the Sort Order by applying "Boosts" to specific categories
      - Library Boost: Prioritizes streams already in your library within each category. This is useful for quickly identifying specific episodes or manually added content.
      - Language Boost: Gives priority to streams matching your "Preferred Languages". Higher boosts may rank lower-quality streams higher if they contain your preferred language.
      - SEL Score Boost: Prioritizes results with higher SEL scores, regardless of resolution or quality.
      - Seeders Boost (P2P Only): Ensures streams with the highest seeder counts appear at the top.

- Recommended Optional SELs
  - You can now select these SELs to be added directly inside your config. No more copy-pasting and editing them off GitHub.
    - ☑ NZB-Only: health-checked Zyclops/UsenetStreamer results only.
    - DV Profile 5: removes DV Only Non-Remux streams.
    - 4K Remux: removes 4k Remux due to device compatability or file size.
    - Bitrate Hardcap (Mobile): removes bitrate over 4K@8Mbps · 1080p@3Mbps · 720p@2Mbps.
    - Bitrate Softcap (Travel): dynamic, doesn't remove higher-bitrate streams if choices are few
- Pin & Passthrough Options
  - These options allow specific streams to bypass Standard SEL filter and optionally appear at the top. Rest of the results will still follow default SEL setup.
    - Language Passthrough: Ensures a set number of streams (you choose) in a specific language always show up, even if they would normally be filtered out. Option to pin these, or to only apply for Anime.
    - Visual Tag Passthrough: Allows up to 5 results for specific tags (like DV, HDR, or SDR) to bypass filters and optionally be pinned to the top.
    - Usenet Passthrough: Allows a specified number of top Usenet results per category to bypass filters, though they typically remain ranked below cached debrid stream.
    - Usenet Boost: Adds a Preferred Stream Expression to allow cached usenet be ranked on the same tier as cached Debrid.
    - Top 1 Pin: Can be configured to pin the single best result per Resolution (max 3) or per Quality/Resolution (max 6).
- Formatter Choice
  - Toggle between my recommended clean formatter, a "Full RSE" for debugging, or keep your existing formatter entirely

That's it for this All-in-One Complete template. Most Optional SELs can be added right inside the Template Wizard. Lots of options to play around with, dozens of unique setup possible. The Partial Setup template has just the SEL Only and the Formatter only, so nothing else in your config will get changed.
